If you like the following:

- [NextJS + Custom Express](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/)
- [Emotion CSS-in-JS](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion)

You may like my prototyping setup, it is designed to be small and simple. There are 8 dependencies. I like to write my own styles so if you need a style library you will need to add your own.

### Setup

Make sure NodeJS version 10+ is installed on your machine. Then run.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Deploy To Production

You can use my [Render](https://render.com/i/internet-gift-from-jim) invite. Other services such as [Heroku](https://heroku.com) and [Now V1](https://now.sh) are fine too.

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```
