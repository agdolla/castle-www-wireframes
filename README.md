# 👋

I was honored by the Castle team with the privilege to create a set of wireframes for our new creation platform. As a team we decided the web artifacts should serve the greater goal of marketing. I spent a couple of days and reached a set of conclusions. I am overjoyed to showcase the wireframes/concepts and allow the team to influence every decision for the following cycles.

#### Some opinions

- Static marketing sites get stale after a period of time. They may win awards and look nice, but we need the meta language of our product to grow organically. I thought my approach to this was crystal clear, help me understand where it is wrong.
- I would like to allow anyone to write, and I think as a team we would enjoy curating this content.
- The community may be able to produce better documentation than us.
- Designs should allow for incremental improvement. Choices should be easy to delete, and pivot from.

#### Properties of the wireframes

- All pages are not mobile friendly. Sorry.
- Nothing is clickable, you must view each route individually. Sorry, this may change in a future prototype.
- All pages are mostly monochrome with a splash of color.
- System fonts were used to avoid masking the information hiearchies effectiveness. If the design is effective, the font shouldn't alter this quality.
- Real assets from artists were used on purpose to help viewers imagine. I forgot accurate attribution this time around, will delete the repo if this offends anyone.
- All pages are unpolished and leave a massive space for discussion. Please, tell me what you want and what speaks to you! 🙏

### I just want to run it locally.

Make sure NodeJS version 10+ is installed on your machine. Then run:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Notes

- I run a writing platform where labor occurs on the weekend. The technical, business logic and design decisions between that product and this one will have absolutely zero overlap.

- As always, it is always fair game to say delete it all and start over.
