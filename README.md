## What is the expectation here?

- Feel free to share any feedback!
- If people like this direction we will probably go with it.
- Everything is fair game to comment on.

## Details

#### User Search

- Imagine a popover where you can select a name and create either a group chat or a DM.
- Icon to the right allows you to create a group and then invite others later.
- We can tuck other settings into that popover.

#### Annoucements

- Read only, a way for us to communicate with everyone.

#### Chats

- Shows the last thing a user said.
- Selecting the same group hides the sidebar to get back some real estate.

#### Chat Window

- Imagine the bottom right allows for emojis/stickers.
- I'd like to be able to start a game session with a group.

## Ideas

- If the UI is taking up too much space. We can make the right chat overlay the left chat instead of being side by side.
- If we don't like using the left side for chat, we can go horizontal like the current developer mode is. I have ideas for how that could look.

## Final notes

Thank you for taking the time to look!
